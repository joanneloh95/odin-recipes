        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 tbsp shaoxing wine (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Mapo Tofu:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili oil (you can substitute with cooking oil)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 oz ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted and ground Sichuan peppercorn</li>
            <li>400g of ground pork, chicken, beef, or any plant based meat</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 block (14 oz) silken tofu, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp corn starch</li>
            <li>1 red chili, chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients for sauce in a mixing bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a cast iron wok over medium heat.</li> 
            <li>Add cooking oil, chili oil, chopped garlic, ginger, chili and green onions. Stir fry all together about 1 minute then stir in Sichuan peppercorn powder.</li> 
            <li>Add in your choice of ground meat and breakdown into small pieces. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until fully cooked and ground edges.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce mixture and stir fry sauce, protein and aromatic vegetables together about 2 to 3 minutes.</li> 
            <li>Pour stock and deglaze bottom of wok. Bring it to boil. Add cubed tofu and carefully stir. You want to keep the shape of tofu as square as possible.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix cornstarch and 2 tbsp water. Pour starch mixture into boiling mapo tofu base while carefully stirring. This is very important, because cornstarch mixture will thicken mapo tofu immediately only where it added into.</li>
            <li>Garnish with some chopped green onions and extra Sichuan peppercorn powder. Serve with warm cooked rice. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
