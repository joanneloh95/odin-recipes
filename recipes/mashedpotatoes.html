        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of the dishes that I enjoy as my guilty pleasure as a huge fan of potatoes myself.</p>
        <p>I usually enjoy eating this with some western mains.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2kg Potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>3 to 5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>10 tbsp unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>2.5 cups warm heavy cream</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut potatoes into quarters or halves depending on sizes.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and pour just enough cold water to cover potatoes. Add garlic if you’d like to and 1 tbsp salt.</li> 
            <li>Cook potatoes until chopstick tender, about 15 to 18 minutes over high heat.</li>
            <li>Drain cooked potatoes and rice them using a potato ricer for the silky smooth mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li>Add butter, heavy cream and 2 tsp salt. Mix everything well. Add extra 1/3 cup of warm heavy cream if you’re not serving immediately. Serve with extra butter and black pepper to your taste. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
